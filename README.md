# INF213_UFV

This is a repository containing some coding as I learned data structures in my college. The "PRATICA" folders are some of projects used to learn some subjects from this
class, like lists, templates, trees, maps, and others. The "TRABALHO" folders contain some of more complex coding that use these topics,like dynamic matrix and ragged array,
a game similar to the classic "Snake" game, and a Markov chain algorithm. All of these projects use objected oriented programming and lots of concepts from the C++ language.
